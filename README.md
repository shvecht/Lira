## Why Spent?

Israeli banks have terrible exports, YNAB doesn't speak ILS gracefully, and every "cloud finance" app wants you to hand over your bank password. Spent is the answer for people who'd rather just run something on their own laptop.

Your transactions get pulled directly from your bank with [`israeli-bank-scrapers`](https://github.com/eshaham/israeli-bank-scrapers), stored in a local SQLite file you can `cp` and back up like any other file, and categorized by an AI provider you choose: paid Claude, free local Ollama, or nothing at all.

The trade-off is honest: you self-host, you trust the scraper, and you accept that banks may not love automation. In return you get a fast, beautiful, fully offline dashboard that never phones home.

## Features

<table>
<tr>
<td width="33%" valign="top">

### 🏦 Israeli bank integration
Isracard, Bank Hapoalim, and Max work out of the box. Visa Cal and Bank Leumi are on the roadmap.

</td>
<td width="33%" valign="top">

### 🤖 AI categorization
Choose Claude (Anthropic) for best accuracy, Ollama for fully local LLMs, or skip and categorize manually.

</td>
<td width="33%" valign="top">

### 🔒 Local-only & encrypted
Credentials encrypted with AES-256-GCM. Server binds to `127.0.0.1` only — never reachable from your LAN or the internet.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

### 📊 Budgets with pacing
Hierarchical categories, monthly targets, "ahead of pace" hero card, and per-category drilldown.

</td>
<td valign="top">

### 🌓 Light & dark theme
Polished buttercream-and-sage palette in light mode, warm charcoal in dark. System-aware by default.

</td>
<td valign="top">

### 🍎 Menu bar / tray app
Native companion in your menu bar (macOS) or notification area (Windows). Status indicator, one-click open dashboard, sync, and start/stop/restart the service.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

### 🎯 Auto-detected transfers
Credit card payments and inter-account moves are recognized and excluded from spending totals.

</td>
<td valign="top">

### 📅 Multi-month history
Pull up to 3 months of transactions per sync (configurable). Most banks support 12 months total.

</td>
<td valign="top">

### 🔍 Merchant memory
Once you correct an AI categorization, Spent remembers — same merchant goes to the right category next time.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="3" valign="top">

### 🌐 English & Hebrew (RTL)
Toggle between English (default) and עברית from **Settings → Appearance**. Hebrew flips the entire app to right-to-left with translated UI, bank names, predefined categories, currency, and date formatting. Powered by [`next-intl`](https://next-intl.dev/) — drop in a new `<locale>.json` under [`src/i18n/messages/`](src/i18n/messages/) to add another language.

Everything inside the dashed box stays on your laptop. The only outbound traffic is to your bank (for scraping) and optionally `api.anthropic.com` (if you chose Claude) or `localhost:11434` (if you chose Ollama).

## Supported banks

| Bank | Type | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Isracard** | Credit card | ✅ Supported |
| **Bank Hapoalim** (incl. Poalim wallets) | Bank | ✅ Supported |
| **Max** (formerly Leumi Card) | Credit card | ✅ Supported |
| Visa Cal | Credit card | 🚧 Planned |
| Bank Leumi | Bank | 🚧 Planned |

Don't see your bank? Adding a scraper is a small wrapper around `israeli-bank-scrapers` — see [Contributing](#contributing).

## AI providers

| | **Claude** (Anthropic) | **Ollama** (local) | **None** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cost | ~₪0.004 per sync | Free | Free |
| Accuracy | Best | Good (depends on model) | Manual |
| Network | `api.anthropic.com` | `localhost:11434` | Offline |
| Setup | API key | Install Ollama + pull a model | Nothing |

Default model when Claude is selected: `claude-haiku-4-5` (cheap, fast, accurate for categorization). For Ollama, `llama3.2:3b` is the recommended default.

You can change providers any time from **Settings → AI provider**. Existing categorizations are kept.

## Requirements

- **Node.js 22+**
- **macOS 13+**, **Ubuntu 22+** (with systemd), or **Windows 11**
- **Build tools for the menubar** (only if you want the tray; `npm run setup` will offer to install these for you if they're missing):
  - macOS: Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`)
  - Windows: .NET 8 SDK (`winget install Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.8`)
- A bank account with **2FA disabled** (most Israeli banks require this for automation — OneZero is the exception)

## Install

> Prefer a screenshot-by-screenshot walkthrough? The [step-by-step install guides](https://shaya16.github.io/Spent/getting-started/) on the docs site cover macOS and Windows separately, with build-tool setup and tray-app gotchas spelled out.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shaya16/Spent.git
cd spent
npm install
npm run setup
```

`npm run setup` does everything: builds the Next.js app, installs the always-on service (LaunchAgent on macOS / systemd on Linux / Task Scheduler on Windows), builds the platform menubar from source, installs it to the standard location, registers it to auto-start at login, and opens the dashboard. On Windows it also writes a `127.0.0.1 spent.localhost` line to your hosts file (the only step that asks for Administrator). macOS and Linux resolve `*.localhost` natively, so setup runs sudo-free there.

On Linux there is no native menubar. `npm run setup` installs the service and opens the browser. Control the service with `npm run service:*` (see below).

First launch of the menubar on macOS/Windows shows an unsigned-binary warning (Gatekeeper / SmartScreen). That's expected: you built it locally and didn't pay for a code-signing certificate. Right-click → Open (macOS) or "More info" → "Run anyway" (Windows). One-time.

Open **`http://spent.localhost:41234`** and bookmark it.

## First-time setup

In the browser:

1. **Connect your bank** — credentials are AES-256-GCM encrypted before they touch disk.
2. **Choose an AI provider** — Claude (default), Ollama, or none.
3. **Set your monthly ceiling** — total spend you want to stay under each month.
4. **Set per-category budgets** — type an amount on any category to budget it; leave blank to track without a limit.
5. **Done.** Sync starts automatically: 3 months of transactions, then AI categorization.

## How you'll use it

| What you want | Run |
|---|---|
| Just use the app (no coding) | Open `http://spent.localhost:41234` |
| Code and see changes instantly | `npm run dev` → `http://127.0.0.1:3000` |
| Update the always-on app after editing | `npm run service:reload` |

Rare cases:

- Changed the menu bar app source → `npm run menubar:install:mac` (or `:windows`) to rebuild and reinstall.
- Changed install scripts or hostname → `npm run service:uninstall && npm run service:install`.

## Service commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run service:status` | Running? Bound to loopback? |
| `npm run service:start` / `:stop` | Start/stop now |
| `npm run service:reload` | Rebuild and restart |
| `npm run service:logs` | Tail server logs |
| `npm run service:open` | Open the app in your browser |
| `npm run service:uninstall` | Remove auto-start and hosts entry. `data/` is untouched. |

## Uninstall

```bash
npm run uninstall
```

Reverses everything `npm run setup` installed:

- Stops the background service and removes the LaunchAgent / Task Scheduler entry / systemd unit.
- Windows: removes the `127.0.0.1 spent.localhost` line from your hosts file (asks for Administrator). macOS/Linux don't have a hosts entry to remove unless you're upgrading from an older install — in that case the legacy `spent.local` line is cleaned up automatically.
- Quits the menubar, removes the installed app, and removes it from Login Items / Startup.

**Kept on purpose:**

- `data/`: your transactions, budgets, and encryption key. To wipe your data: `rm -rf data/`.
- The repo itself. To remove Spent entirely: `rm -rf data/ && cd .. && rm -rf spent/`.

If you only want to remove the menubar but keep the always-on web app:

- **macOS**: `rm -rf ~/Applications/Spent.app` and remove "Spent" from System Settings → General → Login Items.
- **Windows**: delete `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Spent\` and remove `Spent.lnk` from `shell:startup`.

If you only want to remove the always-on service but keep the menubar (so it's there if you reinstall later): `npm run service:uninstall`.

## Security at a glance

| Concern | Defense |
|---|---|
| Credentials at rest | AES-256-GCM, encryption key file mode `0600` (server refuses to start otherwise) |
| Network exposure | Bound to `127.0.0.1` only — not reachable from your LAN or the internet |
| Browser CSRF | Origin / Referer validation on every mutation |
| Bot detection | Chromium sandbox on by default (`SPENT_DISABLE_CHROMIUM_SANDBOX=1` to opt out) |
| Bundle integrity | `israeli-bank-scrapers`, `better-sqlite3`, and `@anthropic-ai/sdk` pinned to exact versions |
| Browser hardening | Strict CSP, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Permissions-Policy` locks down camera/mic/geo/payment |

**Turn on full-disk encryption** (FileVault / BitLocker / LUKS). The encryption key file sits next to the database, so disk-level protection is your last line of defense if the laptop is lost.

Full threat model and responsible-disclosure policy → [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Where your data lives

- `data/spent.db` — transactions, categories, budgets, settings
- `data/.encryption-key` — 32-byte AES key, mode `0600`
- `~/Library/Logs/Spent/` (macOS) / `~/.local/state/spent/log/` (Linux) — service logs

Back up `data/` like any other folder. To migrate to a new machine, copy `data/` over and run `npm run service:install`.

## Troubleshooting

> The [Troubleshooting docs](https://shaya16.github.io/Spent/troubleshooting/) cover Defender, Gatekeeper, Cloudflare bot challenges, and bank-specific quirks in more depth.

- **Port 41234 in use** → `lsof -nP -iTCP:41234 -sTCP:LISTEN` (Unix) or `netstat -ano | findstr :41234` (Windows). Kill the offender and re-run install.
- **Gatekeeper blocks `Spent.app`** → right-click → Open → Open. One-time.
- **Linux: "systemd user instance not available"** → `loginctl enable-linger $USER`.
- **Windows: hosts edit fails / `spent.localhost` doesn't resolve** → re-run install from an elevated PowerShell (Win+X → "Terminal (Admin)") so it can edit `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`. After the edit, the installer flushes the DNS cache automatically; if you edited hosts manually, run `ipconfig /flushdns`. `http://127.0.0.1:41234` always works as a fallback.
- **Bank scrape fails with "Cloudflare"** → temporarily run with `SPENT_DISABLE_CHROMIUM_SANDBOX=1` to let Puppeteer use a real Chrome profile.

## Roadmap

- [x] Hebrew UI with full RTL layout
- [ ] Visa Cal scraper
- [ ] Bank Leumi scraper
- [ ] CSV / OFX export
- [ ] Custom user-defined categories
- [ ] Mobile companion (Phase 2)
- [ ] Multiple workspaces in the menu bar / tray app

## Contributing

Spent is built for personal use first, open-source second. PRs welcome for:

- **New bank integrations** — add to `BANK_PROVIDERS` in [src/lib/types.ts](src/lib/types.ts), map to `CompanyTypes` in [src/server/scrapers/index.ts](src/server/scrapers/index.ts), flip `enabled: true`.
- **New AI providers** — implement the `AIProvider` interface from [src/server/ai/types.ts](src/server/ai/types.ts), register in [src/server/ai/factory.ts](src/server/ai/factory.ts), and add an option to the setup wizard.
- **New languages** — add `<locale>.json` under [src/i18n/messages/](src/i18n/messages/), mirroring the keys in `en.json`, and append the locale to [src/i18n/routing.ts](src/i18n/routing.ts). Toggle wires itself up automatically.
- **UI polish, bug fixes, documentation.**

Conventions:

- TypeScript strict mode. No `any` without a comment.
- Conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`.
- Comments only where the "why" isn't obvious. No em dashes in code, commits, or docs.
